# RapidFormFiller

A high-speed, configurable user script to automatically fill Google Forms in milliseconds. Ideal for time-sensitive situations like hostel allotments, course registrations, or flash sales where every second counts.

### My Experience
> I originally created this script for my own college's hostel allotment, which was a first-come, first-served process where the form opened at a specific time. Manually filling the form was too slow. This script allowed me to pre-load almost all my answers that I knew will be asked compulsarily and fill the form, including all validation checks, in under 200 milliseconds. It worked perfectly. I'm sharing it so others can use this advantage.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: The Golden Rule

**"My form didn't fill! What do I do?"**

This almost always means Google has updated their internal code for forms. The fix is usually simple:

1.  **Open the Developer Console:** On the Google Form page, press the **F12** key and click the **"Console"** tab.
2.  **Look for an Error:** The script will print an error like `‚ùå Form Filler Pro: Could not find any question containers...`. This confirms the problem.
3.  **Find the New Container Class:**
    *   Right-click on the text of any question on the form and choose **"Inspect"**.
    *   In the HTML code that appears, move your mouse up a few lines until you find the element that highlights the *entire* question block (both the question text and the answer area).
    *   Note down its `class` attribute (e.g., `class="Qr7Oae"` or `class="some-other-name"`).
4.  **Update the Script:**
    *   Open the script editor in Tampermonkey.
    *   Find the line: `const GOOGLE_FORM_QUESTION_CONTAINER_CLASS = '.Qr7Oae';`
    *   Replace `.Qr7Oae` with the new class name you found (don't forget the dot `.` at the beginning).
    *   Save the script and refresh the form. It should work now!
